## Getting Started

**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**
**Modify this file to match your project, remove sections that don't apply. For example: delete the testing section if the currect project doesn't require testing.**

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node and NPM
- Web browser (Google chrome)
- Code Editor (VSCode)

### Development (Running locally)

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/basitkorede/html-template.git

```

- Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

To run StyleLint by itself, you may run the lint task:

```bash
npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
```

Or to automatically fix issues found (where possible):

```bash
npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}" --fix
```

You can also check against Webhint:

```bash
npx hint --telemetry=off .
```
